# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design


Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
  The client for this project was DriverPass. The client wanted to design a system to for their business providing driving lessons to customers. This system needed to be able to schedule appointments with driving instructors and process customer orders.

What did you do particularly well?
  I feel that throughout this project I did a good job working with my UML Diagrams.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  If I were to revise a part of this project it would be my business requirements document. I feel I could have been more detailed and provided more information about requirements requested by the client.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  It is important to correctly interpret the user's needs as it can prevent wasted time during design. Correct interpretation can save costs, reduce project time, and help provide a better experience for the user.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
  In the future I feel I will try and be as detailed as possible when interpretting client or user requests. Having as much information before starting the design process can help reduce wasted time and prevent confusion.
